## Pie & Doughnut Chart

Pie and doughnut charts are probably the most commonly used charts. They are divided into segments, the arc of each segment shows the proportional value of each piece of data.

They are excellent at showing the relational proportions between data.

Pie and doughnut charts are the same, but have one different default value - their cutout. This equates to what portion of the inner should be cut out. This defaults to 0 for pie charts, and `50` for doughnuts.

|Name	|Type	|Description	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|`DataSource`	|Array	|The dataSource that contains data to display.	|
|`Title`	|String	|The Chart Title.	|
|`Legend Position`	|String	|Defines the position of legend and can be one of the following values: `top`, `bottom`, `left`,`right`,`center`,`chartArea`,`hidden`, The default value is `top`, which means the legend will displayed on Tap of the chart.	|
|`Cut Out`	|Number	| The portion of the chart that is cut out of the middle. It's considered to be pixels.	if it's > 0 the Pie Chart become Doughnut Chart.|
|`Display tooltip`	|Boolean	|If set to `false` the tooltip won't appear	|
|`Color`	|Array	|A set of colors that can be used in the pie chart   	|

#### DataSource
|Name	|Type	|Required	|Description	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|`Label`	|String	|Yes	|The label for the dataset which appears in the legend and tooltips.	|
|`Value`	|Number	|Yes	|The value for the dataset.	|
|`Background Color`	|Color	|No	|The line fill color. If it's empty, a random color is generated	|
|`Border Color`	|Color	|No	|The line color. if it's empty it will take background color instead.	|

Some example of data that can be used :

```
[{"label": "Title", "value": 10}, ...]

[{"label": "Title", "value": 10, "color": "#84a0d0"}, ...]

[{"label": "Title", "value": 10, "color": "#84a0d0", "borderColor": "red"}, ...]

```

##  Line Chart
A line chart is a way of plotting data points on a line. Often, it is used to show trend data, or the comparison of two data sets.

#### Properties

|Name	|Type	|Description	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|`DataSource`	|Array	|The dataSource that contains data to display.	|
|`Title`	|String	|The Chart Title.	|
|`Legend Position`	|String	|Defines the position of legend and can be one of the following values: `top`, `bottom`, `left`,`right`,`center`,`chartArea`,`hidden`, The default value is `top`, which means the legend will displayed on Tap of the chart.	|
|`Display grid`	|Boolean	|If set to `false` the grid will disappear	|
|`Display tooltip`	|Boolean	|If set to `false` the tooltip won't appear	|
|`Data`	|DataType	|Contains the properties for chart series   	|
|`Display x-Axis Value`	|Boolean	|If set to `false` the x-Axis will disappear	|
|`Display x-Axis Value`	|Boolean	|If set to `false` the y-Axis will disappear	|

#### DataType
|Name	|Type	|Required	|Description	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|`Label`	|String	|No	|The label for the dataset which appears in the legend and tooltips.	|
|`Source`	|String	|Yes	|The attribut name using for mapping data from the DataSource	|
|`Background Color`	|Color	|No	|The line fill color. If it's empty, a random color is generated	|
|`Border Color`	|Color	|No	|The line color. if it's empty it will take background color instead.	|
|`Point Color`	|Color	|No	|The fill color for points. if it's empty it will take background color instead.	|
|`Point Styles`	|Color	|No	|Style of the point	and can be one of the following values: `circle`,`cross`,`crossRot`,`dash`,`line`,`rect`,`rectRounded`,`rectRot`,`star`,`triangle`, `none`|
|`Point Size`	|String	|No	|The radius of the point shape. If set to 0, the point is not rendered. default value is `5`	|
|`Tension`	|Number	|No	|Bezier curve tension of the line. Set to 0 to draw straightlines, default value is `0`. Example : `0.3`	|
|`Fill`	|Boolean	|No	|If set to `true`, the line chart become Area chart.	|
|`Stepped`	|Boolean	|No	|If set to `true`, the line chart become a Stepped Line chart.	|

#### DataSource
```
[{"x": "Value 1", "y": 10}, {"x": "Value 2", "y": 25}, ...]

[{"x": "Value 1", "y": 10, z: 20}, {"x": "Value 2", "y": 25, "z": 40}, ...]

[{"x": "Value 1", source1: 10, source2: 20, ...}, {"x": "Value 2", source1: 25, source2: 40, ...}, ...]

```

- `y, z, source1, source2 will be used in the source field to map data`

###  Area Chart
Area Charts are base on line charts with fill is set to `true` and the you should also set the background color.

###  Scatter Chart
Scatter charts are based on basic line charts with the x-axis changed to a linear axis. To use a scatter chart, the data's border color should be Transparent.

###  Stepped Chart
 Stepped Charts are line chart in which points are connected by horizontal and vertical line segments, looking like steps of a staircase. Step line charts are used when it is necessary to highlight the irregularity of changes.

##  Polar Area Chart
Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value.

This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.

##  Bar Chart
A bar chart provides a way of showing data values represented as vertical bars. It is sometimes used to show trend data, and the comparison of multiple data sets side by side

### Dumbbell Chart

##  Bubble Chart
A bubble chart is used to display three dimensions of data at the same time. The location of the bubble is determined by the first two dimensions and the corresponding horizontal and vertical axes. The third dimension is represented by the size of the individual bubbles.

##  Radar Chart
A radar chart is a way of showing multiple data points and the variation between them.

They are often useful for comparing the points of two or more different data sets.

##  Mixed Chart

## TODO
- Add Documentation
- Add examples
- Support mixed chart
- Make Radar more dynamic
- Support radialbar charts
